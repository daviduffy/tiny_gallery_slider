# Tiny Gallery Slider

A horizontal image slider made with vanilla javascript.

[Demo](http://daviduffy.me/slider/)

## Usage
Include the `tiny-gallery-slider.min.css` and `tiny-gallery-slider.min.js` in your asset pipeline or directly in the head and body of your site. 

#### HTML
Structure markup as a container `<div>` with a class, id, or other attribute to target. Include a `<ul>` which will act as the slider track, and `<li>`'s for each of the slides. 

  ```HTML
  <div class="class-to-target">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img src="img/slide.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="img/slide.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="img/slide.png" />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  ```

#### CSS
Pick which way suits you best: you can include the regular or minified `tiny-gallery-slider` css file from the `dist` directory, or you can take the `app.sass` file from the `sass` directory if that works better.

#### JavaScript
Include `tiny-gallery-slider.js` or `tiny-gallery-slider.min.js` in your pipeline or add as a script tag directly to the end of the body.


#### Initialization
Target the `<div>` element from above using whatever method you choose. 

  ```JavaScript
  g_s.init({
    element: document.querySelector('.class-to-target')
  });
  ```

#### Preventing FOUC (flash of unstyled content)
For a brief moment before classes the JS runs, the styles applied by your site's CSS will be all that is governing the style of your slide elements. There is a strategy that eliminates that effect:
  1. Give your slides a class set them to `opacity: 0` in your CSS. Slides will be set to `opacity: 1` by the slider CSS once the JS has run.
  2. Add a `<div>` element with the class `g-slider__curtain` just after the slide track closing `</ul>` tag. The curtain will fade out once the slider is ready. Optionally, you may add any inner element with the class `g-slider__spinner`. Styles to make the spinner rotate are already present in the CSS.

  ```HTML
  <div class="g-slider__curtain">
    <svg class="g-slider__spinner" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 73.99 73.99"><defs><style>._l{fill:none;stroke:#999;stroke-miterlimit:10;stroke-width:2px;}</style></defs><title>Loader</title><g id="Layer_2" data-name="Layer 2"><path class="_l" d="M73 37.66A36 36 0 1 1 36.28 1" id="Layer_1-2" data-name="Layer 1"/></g></svg>
  </div>
  ```
  _note: `svg` spinner image included with example is shown in the [demo](http://daviduffy.me/slider/)_

## Features

#### Scroll Modes:
 - **Endless:** allows scrolling in either direction on an endless loop. Currently requires user to put the "first" slide at index 1 in their markup (not index 0).
 - **Rewind:** when scrolling past the last slide, the slider visibly rewinds back to the first slide
 
#### Animation:
 - scrolling in either direction supported. fading not supported.
 - animation timing and easing set in CSS via the `g-slider--is-animating` class
 - classes for previous, current, and next slides:
   ```CSS
   .g-slider__slide--is-prev
   .g-slider__slide--is-current
   .g-slider__slide--is-next
   ```

#### Touch-enabled:
 - Slider follows finger input for swipe and flick.

#### Lazy loading: (No AJAX)
 - Slide images can be loaded on-demand by substituting `data-src` for the normal `src` attribute. When a slide with a `data-src` attribute is 2 slides away from the current slide, the image is loaded by adding a `src` attribute and setting it to the value of the `data-src` attribute. The `data-src` attribute is removed.

  ```HTML
  <div class="g-slider__slide g-slider__slide--4">
    <img src="img/img-4.png" />
    <!-- this slide's image will load when the page loads -->
  </div>
  <div class="g-slider__slide g-slider__slide--5">
    <img data-src="img/img-5.png" />
    <!-- this slide's image will load when the user scrolls close it it. Slide 3 if scrolling right, or slide 7 if scrolling left. -->
  </div>
  ```

 - Currently you must have at least 5 images with `src` attributes when the page loads, with the `current_index` set to the center slide.

#### Responsive:
The height of the slider is determined by the `--height` CSS custom property, which you can use or over-write with your own CSS. Media queries are not supplied, so you may write your own MQ's for screen sizes and portrait/landscape.

All child elements in the slider are fluid and will adjust based on the height of this property. The slider recalculates slide widths and track position, re-centering the current slide automatically if the screen dimensions change.

#### Load-in Curtain:
 - Loading spinner on a solid white background is shown until the images are centered on the page (~0.5s). At 0.5s, the curtain and spinner fade out and are removed from the DOM.

## In Progress:
 - Change arbitrary setTimeout delay into actual load-in event triggered when all initial images are loaded.

## Issues:
 - Debug occasional script crash (?)
 - Address blink on swipe off either end of array

## Planned:
 - Accessibility audit and update
 - Eliminate 'setScrollDirection'
 - Add autoprefixer
 - ...
