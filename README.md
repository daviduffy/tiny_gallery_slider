# Tiny Gallery Slider

[Demo](http://daviduffy.me/slider/)

A horizontal image slider made with vanilla javascript.



## Features:

### Scroll Modes:
 - **Endless:** allows scrolling in either direction on an endless loop. Currently requires user to put the "first" slide at index 1 in their markup (not index 0).
 - **Rewind:** when scrolling past the last slide, the slider visibly rewinds back to the first slide
 
### Animation:
 - only scrolling (no fading) supported
 - animation timing and easing set in CSS via the `g-slider--is-animating` class
 - classes for previous, current, and next slides:
    ```CSS
        .g-slider__slide--is-prev
        .g-slider__slide--is-current
        .g-slider__slide--is-next
    ```


### Lazy loading: (No AJAX)
 - Slide images can be loaded on-demand by substituting `data-src` for the normal `src` attribute. When a slide with a `data-src` attribute is 2 slides away from the current slide, the image is loaded by adding a `src` attribute and setting it to the value of the `data-src` attribute. The `data-src` attribute is removed.

    ```HTML
        <div class="g-slider__slide g-slider__slide--4">
          <img src="img/img-4.png" />
          <!-- this slide's image will load when the page loads -->
        </div>
        <div class="g-slider__slide g-slider__slide--5">
          <img data-src="img/img-5.png" />
          <!-- this slide's image will load when the user scrolls close it it. Slide 3 if scrolling right, or slide 7 if scrolling left. -->
        </div>
    ```

 - Currently you must have at least 5 images with `src` attributes when the page loads, with the `current_index` set to the center slide.

### Responsive:
 - Slider height is determined by the `--height` CSS custom property. All other elements are fluid and will adjust based on the height of this property. The slider recalculates slide widths and track position, re-centering the current slide automatically if the screen dimensions change.

### Load-in Curtain:
 - Loading spinner on a solid white background is shown until the images are centered on the page (~0.5s). At 0.5s, the curtain and spinner fade out and are removed from the DOM.

## In Progress:
 - Change arbitrary setTimeout delay into actual load-in event triggered when all initial images are loaded.

## Planned:
 - Touch scroll follows finger on longer swipe instead of triggering update immediately
 - Accessibility audit and update
 - Pass in settings object via init
 - ...
