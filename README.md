# Tiny Slider

A super lightweight horizontal image slider made with vanilla javascript. 
Intended use is to copy and modify the code directly, move html elements around, etc.



## Features:
 - horizontal sliding (backwards and forwards)
 - animation set in CSS via `g-slider__track--is-animating` class
 - centered image with previous and next images displayed on R and L
 - slide images loaded on-demand when using the `data-src` attribute
 - `g-slider__slide--is-active` class on active slide


## In Progress:
 - Infinite mode (to clone or move, that is the question)


## Planned
 - address intro animation (not desirable)
 - Responsive review
 - Init via object
 - Documentation
